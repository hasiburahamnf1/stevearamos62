                  Are you thinking about setting up a limited company and
                  feeling overwhelmed? Being unsure is not new and is the
                  triggering point to know more about the setting up procedures.
                  Here is the procedure for setting up limited company :

              <span class="home-text05">
                <span>
                  The first step is name approval which requires providing 2
                  names for your company. One name will be required, but ensure
                  the name suggests your business and is unique. It offers an
                  outline of the company’s objective. In case, the proposed name
                  has another existing company in the same then, it is a must to
                  get NOC from that company. In case it has Trademark
                  safeguarded, submit the details.
